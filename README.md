#  C++ Console Games Collection

A collection of **classic and fun console-based games written in C++**.  
This repository is meant to practice **C++ fundamentals, OOP, and game logic**, while recreating simple retro-style games that run directly in the terminal.

Each game is lightweight, written from scratch, and uses **basic C++ (with minimal external libraries)**. Great for beginners who want to learn by building!
